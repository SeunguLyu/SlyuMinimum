## Introduction

From the experience of KMLA 72, we realized how important it is to think everything ahead before we start developing a game. Some features like multi-language support was almost impossible to add later on, and messed up class structures were something that we struggled a lot. So I became more mature in handling these problems. We realized that we have to have at least brief idea about the class structures before we move on to the actual project, and to do that we have to know what we really need for the game. 

{% include gallery id="gallery3" caption="Game design from the very beginning" %}

That is how I went through game design process before we started development. I tried to figure out how the game will look like in the end, and organized key features I wanted the game to have. This was really helpful to begin with, since having clear vision about what we were making helped a lot when we started programming.

{% include gallery id="gallery4" caption="Figma UI prototypes" %}

I created a Figma UI prototypes to give better image of the game to the teammates, which I think really helped in visualizing how the game looks like. The final game keeps almost the same design as the UI prototype, which proves these pre-works were worth doing. 

{% include gallery id="gallery5" caption="Class structure discussion" %}

From the game design I created, my team met for several meetings to discuss and organize the basic class structures we need to start developing the game. Not every class mentioned in the picture was used, but it definately helped in visualizing how the game's back-end is built, and dividing up scripts so that the team can do better collaboration.

The main idea for next game was to create a rogue-like RPG game - a game gerne where you fight with enemies in randomly generated maps, and lose everything if you are defeated. We choose this specific gerne because we wanted to make a game that can be enjoyed any time and anywhere, like even in short break or transportation time. We were inspired by games such as "Hearthstone Battlefield" or "Team Fight Tactics", where every game ends in short amount of time but still entertaining after many plays.

## Summary

We realized that in short games, randomized features really boost the playtime of the game by giving fresh experience to the user every round. That is how we came up with the randomly generated maps, items, and events as the main aspects of our game. Players will have to loot, fight, and explore random maps and terrains to defeat the bosses to win the game.

DFS map, Synergy, Randomize items, Random event, Random looting, Route, Boss, Ending.

## Progress

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Screenshots from the current build" %}

## Achievement

From the project, I was able to learn:

- Adding multi-language support for game development. I was able to add English as supported language in less than a week.

- Better optimized game with efficient use of scripts, shaders, post-processing, and resources.

- Well designed class structures suitable for collaboration. Each team's code is divided, but uses seperate classes to communicate between them. 

## Result

The game is about 70% done, where most essential systems are complete. We aim to finish the game by 2021 winter vacation, when both of the teammate are less busy and have time to work on filling out the contents.
